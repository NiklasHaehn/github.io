Hello, and welcome to my homepage!

I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in American politics and political methodology. Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Postgraduate Associate and CSAP Predoctoral Fellow at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University.

My research focuses on quantitative and computational methodology. I am particularly interested in computational social science, social media, interest groups, and intra-party competition. My current work examines ticket splitting in U.S. federal elections. Using survey data, I ask: Who are ticket splitters, and what motivates them? To answer this, I employ panel data analysis and machine learning techniques.

More broadly, my work combines diverse research designs and data sources, including causal inference for observational data, text analysis, large language models, machine learning, and game theory.

I hold an MSc in Political Economy from the University of Konstanz and a BA in Political Science and Public Law from the University of Mannheim. Prior to graduate school, I worked as Managing Editor at the peer-reviewed journal  [European Union Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/eup), as a public-sector consultant at [PD-Berater der oeffentlichen Hand](https://www.pd-g.de/), and as a research assistant at New York University for Elisa Maria Wirsching and Hye Young You.
